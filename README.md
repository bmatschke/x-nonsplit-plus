# X-nonsplit-plus

We compute the integral points of the moduli curve X<sub>ns</sub><sup>+</sup>(p), where p is a prime. In particular we find that for 11 <= p <= 97 the only integral points are CM points, i.e. they correspond to elliptic curves with complex multiplication.
This project is motivated by Serreâ€™s uniformity problem for Galois representations, which would be solved if one could show that for large p the sets X<sub>ns</sub><sup>+</sup>(p)(Q) and X<sub>ns</sub><sup>+</sup>(p)(Q) consist only of cusps and CM points.
